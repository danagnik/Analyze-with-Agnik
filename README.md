# Project Overview: Bank Loan Analysis with Power BI

## Introduction
The bank loan analysis project in Power BI aims to provide insights into the performance and trends of loan applications, funded amounts, and loan statuses within a financial institution. The analysis utilizes data from SQL databases to create interactive dashboards and visualizations for better decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amounts, and average interest rates.
- Compare good loans and bad loans based on predefined KPIs.
- Provide monthly and state-wise insights into loan application statuses.
- Explore loan characteristics such as term, employee length, purpose, and home ownership.
- Perform month-on-month analysis to identify trends and patterns in loan data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Connection**: Connect to SQL databases to access loan data.
2. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - **Summary Dashboard**: Visualize main KPIs, month-to-date measures, and comparison between good and bad loans.
   - **Overview Dashboard**: Provide insights into monthly loan status, state-wise trends, loan term analysis, and more.
3. **Measure Creation**: Develop measures for average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, average interest rate, and loan classification (good vs. bad).
4. **Date Table Creation**: Generate a date table to facilitate monthly trend analysis by issue date.
5. **Filter Application**: Implement filters for state, grade, purpose, and loan classification to enable interactive exploration.
6. **Project Saving**: Save the Power BI file for further analysis and sharing.

## Findings
- The analysis revealed a steady increase in loan applications over the past few months, indicating growing demand for loans.
- Loans with higher interest rates and debt-to-income ratios were more likely to be classified as bad loans.
- State-wise analysis highlighted variations in loan performance across different regions, with certain states exhibiting higher default rates.
- Term-wise analysis showed that short-term loans were more popular among borrowers compared to long-term loans.
- Purpose of loan and home ownership status also influenced loan performance, with certain purposes and ownership statuses associated with higher default rates.

## Conclusion
The Power BI bank loan analysis project provides valuable insights into the performance and characteristics of loan applications within the financial institution. By leveraging interactive dashboards and visualizations, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize lending practices and mitigate risks.
